<h4>1.	Purpose</h4> 
<p>The Risk Management Methodology at CareNova Health is designed to guide the identification, assessment, treatment, and monitoring of risks that may affect patient safety, clinical operations, data integrity, and regulatory compliance. This framework uses a qualitative risk assessment model, focusing on non-financial impact and probability to determine appropriate risk responses.</p>

<h4>2.	Scope</h4>
<p>This methodology applies to all departments, clinical programs, information systems, and third-party services used by CareNova Health.</p>

<h4>3.	Reporting Risks</h4>
<p>Risks should be reported via the internal Incident & Risk Reporting Tool or emailed to riskmanagement@carenovahealth.org.</p>

<h4>4.	Risk Owner</h4>
<p>The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is responsible for the overall coordination and oversight of risk management activities and is the designated Risk Owner for CareNova Health.</p>

<h4>5.	Risk Scenarios</h4>
<p>Each risk scenario should outline a potential threat to CareNova’s operations or patient care.
The following details must be captured in the enterprise risk register:</p>

- Risk Title
- Risk Description
-	Source (e.g., Clinical, IT, Facilities, Vendor)
-	Affected Services or Patients
-	Location
-	Type of Risk (e.g., Patient Safety, Compliance, Operational)
-	Likelihood (Low, Medium, High)
-	Impact (Low, Medium, High)
-	Overall Risk Level
-	Current Controls
-	Mitigation Actions
-	Residual Risk
-	Risk Owner

    <h4>5.1	Annual Review</h4>
    <p>Risk scenarios are reviewed annually or after significant events.</p>

<h4>6.	Assessing Risk</h4>
<p>CareNova Health uses a qualitative matrix that considers the likelihood and impact of a risk.</p>

<br>

<b>Likelihood</b>
| Likelihood | Description |
|:----------------|:----------------|
| Low   | Unlikely to occur within a year |
| Medium   | Possible within a year |
| High   | Likely or frequent occurrence |

<br>

<b>Impact</b>
| Impact | Description |
|:----------------|:----------------|
| Low   | Minimal clinical or operational disruption |
| Medium   | Moderate disruption or temporary patient care impact |
| High   | Severe harm or major compliance failure |

<br>

<b>Risk Matrix</b>
|  | Impact: Low | Impact: Medium | Impact: High |
|:----------------|:----------------|:----------------|:----------------|
| <b>Likelihood: Low</b>   | Low Risk | Low Risk | Medium Risk |
| <b>Likelihood: Medium</b>   | Low Risk | Medium Risk | High Risk |
| <b>Likelihood: High</b>   | Medium Risk | High Risk | High Risk |

<br>

<h4>7.	Risk Decisions</h4>
<p>The following responses guide decision-making based on risk levels:</p>

- Accept the risk – No action needed beyond monitoring.
-	Avoid the risk – Cease or change activity to eliminate risk. 
-	Treat the risk – Implement controls to reduce impact or likelihood.
- Transfer the risk – Share risk through contracts or insurance.

<h4>8.	Risk Thresholds</h4>

| Risk Level | Decision Authority | Required Action |
|:----------------|:----------------|:----------------|
| Low Risk   | Department Managers | Monitor quarterly   |
| Medium Risk   | Risk Committee  | Develop and implement controls   |
| High Risk   | Executive Team   | Immediate review and mitigation   |

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>8.1	Accepting Risk</b>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Department heads may accept low risks. Medium and high risks require Risk Owner approval.</p>
    
<h4>9.	Review and Monitoring</h4>
<p>The following responses guide decision-making based on risk levels:</p>

- Risks are reviewed quarterly by the Risk Management Committee.
-	Risk owners are responsible for implementing and tracking mitigation plans.
- The methodology is reviewed annually or after major incidents.

<h4>10.	Exceptions</h4>
<p>Any risk-related exceptions to policies or thresholds must be submitted to the Chief Risk Officer for formal approval and documentation</p>
